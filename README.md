# Rape-Reported in India Repository

## About:
This is a mini project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) which focuses the prediction of number of rape reported all 35 states of India from 2001-2010 using a trifactor approach: Police Complaints, Persons, Arrested for Rape, Police Corruption, and Police Strength. 

The mini project implements the data pipeline (except Ethical Consideration): Sample Collection, Data Preparation, Exploratory Analysis, Analytic Visualisation, Algorithmic Optimisation, Information Presentation, and Ethical Consideration.

## Problem Definition
How and what can we use to predict the number of rape cases reported in India by state from 2001-2010, based on various factors (Police Complaints, Persons Arrested for Rape, Police Corruption, Escapes from Police Custody, and Police Strength)?
Which machine learning model is the best to predict it?

## Machine Learning Models Used
Police Complaints, Persons Arrested for Rape:
- K-Nearest Neighbours
- Ridge Regression
- Support Vector Machines

Police Corruption, Kidnapping & Abduction Cases:
- Linear Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbours
- Neural Networks

Police Strength, Escapes from Police Custody:
- Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbours

## Police Complaints Conclusion

As Rape Reported & Complaints_Received/Alleged has a strong correlation of 0.71, indicating a strong linear relationship, Complaints_Received/Alleged is an important predictor of Rape Reported.

Out of the three machine learning models implemented (KNN: Mean Squared Error - 392774666.08746356; Ridge Regression - Mean Squared Error: 125688531.65739381; SVM: Mean Squared Error - 36334198.68137042), SVM has the smallest Mean Squared Error, and is thus the best machine learning model in terms of predicting Rape Reported using Complaints_Received/Alleged.

## Persons Arrested for Rape Conclusion

As Rape Reported & Persons_Arrested has a very strong positive correlation of 0.99, indicating a very strong linear relationship, Persons_Arrested is a very important predictor of Rape Reported.**

**Out of the three machine learning models implemented (KNN: Mean Squared Error - 179844160.2857143; Ridge Regression - Mean Squared Error: 7325195.47854473; SVM: Mean Squared Error - 6753632.837741917), SVM has the smallest Mean Squared Error, and is thus the best machine learning model in terms of predicting Rape Reported using Persons_Arrested.

## Police Corruption Conclusion

The predictor variable, which is the total number of corruption cases reported against police, and the response variable, which is the total number of sexual assault cases reported appear to have a weak correlation of 0.40, indicating a weak to moderate linear relationship. As such, the total number of corruption cases may not be a important predictor of the number of rape cases reported.
    
Three machine learning models were utilised for algorithmic optimisation. A linear regression model, a KNN model and a neural network. Each of the three machine learning models struggle with accuratley predicting the number of sexual assault cases in the test set, which is most likely due to the low correlation between the variables. Of the models, the linear regression model appears to be the most accurate, based on the distribution of the points across the graph, as well as having the lowest mean squared error of 2604659.9424534114, compared to the mean squared error of the KNN model which is 4283014.266875, or of the neural network, which is 3543156.0000.
    
Overall, the linear regression model appears to be the most accurate, however, due to the low correlation of this variable, would not reccomend using it to predict the total number of sexual assault cases.

## Kidnapping & Abduction Conclusion
The predictor variable, which is the total number of kidnapping and abduction cases reported against police, and the response variable, which is the total number of sexual assault cases reported appear to have a strong correlation of 0.72, indicating a strong linear relationship. As such, the total number of kidnapping and abduction cases may be a important predictor of the number of rape cases reported.

Three machine learning models were utilised for algorithmic optimisation. A linear regression model, a KNN model and a neural network. Each of the three machine learning models had a high mean squared error, and as a result, had difficulty accuratley predicting the total number of sexual assault cases in response to the total number of kidnapping and abduction cases. THe linear regression model had the best prediction, and had the lowest mean squared error, compared to the KNN model and the neural network.

Overall, none of the three models appears to be accurate in predicting the total number of sexual assault cases, despite the high correlation. This could be due to a number of reasons, such as a large number of anomalies which need to be filtered out further. Another possibility is that the relationship between the data is not linear, it could be quadratic or another form of clustering.

## Police Strength Conclusion

Police Strength per state and Rape Cases reported has a rather weak correlation of -0.16, which indicates that as Police Strength per state increases, rape cases reported decreases.

After using 3 different machine learning methods, I have found that the polynomial regression method (8th degree) is the best predictor of our response variable, with an explained variance of 0.49, compared to other methods such as linear regression (explained variance of 0.06) and K-Nearest Neighbours (explained variance of 0.38). Values of explained variance are calculated after removal of outliers from the dataset, for all 3 machine learning methods.

## Escapes from Police Custody Conclusion

Escapes from Police Custody per state and Rape Cases per state has a strong correlation of 0.84, which indicates that as Escapes from Police Custody increases, rape cases increases.

Using 3 different machine learning methods (K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Polynomial Regression, Linear Regression), I have found that the polynomial regression (6th degree) method is the best predictor of our response variable, with an explained variance of 0.83, compared to other methods such as Linear Regression (0.68) and K-Nearest Neighbours (0.79). For K-Nearest Neighbours and Polynomial Regression, I used the dataframe with outliers removed as it produced the best predictors, while for Linear Regression, I used the original dataframe as it produced the best explained variance.

## Conclusion

Out of the three predictors (Police Complaints, Persons Arrested for Rape, Police Corruption, Police Strength), the strongest predictors for Rape Reported is Persons Arrested for Rape & Police Complaints, which has the highest absolute correlation value of 0.99 & 0.71 respectively as compared to Police Corruption: 0.16, and Police Strength: 0.42. Police Corruption is the weakest predictor for Rape Reported.

For the strongest predictors, Persons Arrested for Rape & Police Complaints, the best (most accurate) machine learning model is Support Vector Machines (see Persons Arrested for Rape & Police Complaints Conclusion). 

To best predict the number of rape cases reported in India by state from 2001-2010, Support Vector Machines model with the predictor variable: Persons Arrested for Rape OR Police Complaints can be used. As a third best alternative, the Linear Regression model with the predictor variable: Police Corruption (see Police Corruption Conclusion) can be used. 

## What did we learn from this project?
1)Using multiple datasets, extracting variables with different indexes, and merging them properly for accurate analysis

2)Applying data cleaning for large datasets with > 1700 rows for some datasets

3)Removal of outliers from the dataframe using methods such as Z-Score, and Inter-Quartile Range (IQR)

4)New Machine Learning Methods:
Neural Networks, K-Nearest Neighbors, Polynomial Regression, Ridge Regression, Support Vector Machines

5)Collaborating with GitHub Repositories
