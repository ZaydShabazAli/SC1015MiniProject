# Rape-Reported in India Repository

## About:
This is a mini project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) which focuses the prediction of number of rape reported all 35 states of India from 2001-2010 using a trifactor approach: Police Complaints, Police Corruption, and Police Strength. 

The mini project implements the data pipeline (except Ethical Consideration): Sample Collection, Data Preparation, Exploratory Analysis, Analytic Visualisation, Algorithmic Optimisation, Information Presentation, and Ethical Consideration.
